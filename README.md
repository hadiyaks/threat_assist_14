### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
SentinelLink is a specialized cybersecurity first-responder chatbot designed to triage digital threats in real-time. It provides users with instant, rule-based diagnoses of issues like ransomware and phishing while integrating live URL scanning to verify suspicious links.

### The Problem statement
Cybercrime victims often lose critical "golden hour" time because they don't know if an issue is a real threat or how to report it. Existing AI tools can sometimes give vague or "hallucinated" security advice, leading to further data loss or confusion.

### The Solution
We solve this by using a deterministic, rule-based logic engine that provides 100% reliable security advice based on specific threat patterns. The app integrates the VirusTotal API for objective link analysis and provides direct redirection to official legal redress portals like IC3 and Cybercrime.gov.in.
